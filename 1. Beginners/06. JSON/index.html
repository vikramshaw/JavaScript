          JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data
          interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy
          for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used for
          transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as
          for storing configuration settings and data.

          In JavaScript, JSON is represented as a string, and it closely
          resembles JavaScript object literal notation. It consists of key-value
          pairs, where keys must be strings, and values can be strings, numbers,
          booleans, arrays, or nested objects. The key-value pairs are separated
          by commas, and the entire JSON object is enclosed in curly braces {}.
